# Ping Pong WebSocket App

A real-time ping pong game built with WebSockets. Just a fun project to learn how WebSockets work and build something interactive.

## What's Inside

- **Backend** (`Be Ping Pong app Week-16-Websockets/`) - Node.js server handling WebSocket connections
- **Frontend** (`Fe Ping Pong app Week-16/`) - React app for the game interface

## Getting Started

### Backend
```bash
cd "Be Ping Pong app Week-16-Websockets"
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd "Fe Ping Pong app Week-16"
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

The backend sets up a WebSocket server that handles real-time communication between players. The frontend connects to this server and updates the game state instantly as players interact.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- WebSockets
- React + Vite
